🏭 Machine Failure Prediction
Predict potential machine failures using sensor data to reduce downtime and optimize industrial maintenance.

📖 Project Overview
The Machine Failure Prediction project uses machine learning to forecast machine failures using sensor data. This enables preventive maintenance, minimizing production downtime and costs.

❗ Problem Statement
Unexpected machine failures can halt production, causing financial loss. Predicting failures in advance allows maintenance teams to act proactively and prevent breakdowns.
